    Hey

    So I wanted to talk to you

    Most of the backend is finished, I would need you to add some additonal features

    Some are complicated, some aren't

    but the main thing that I need is to convert the current layout of

    Would you be able to do that?

    I don't think it matters but I just wanted to add that I am also russian/jewish like you!
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:21pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh haha that's awesome

    And yeah I think that looks doable

    So what backend framework are you using?

    And is the front end just pure JavaScript/Jquery/html/Css?

    Also so you want a scrolling sidebar with categories

    And then a pandora replica main page?

    Do you still want videos to be embedded?
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:26pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Give me a couple of minutes
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:26pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Sure
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:27pm
    Arthur Underwood

    php, javascript/ jquery, ajax, html

    it was mostly written in that
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:27pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    What about the back end?
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:27pm
    Arthur Underwood

    "Also so you want a scrolling sidebar with categories"

    tell me what you mean by this end

    *tell me what you mean by scrolling side bar with categories

    the left side bar isn't a categories side bar

    it's a previous searches done by the user side bar
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:28pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    It seems like there's a scrolling thing there
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:28pm
    Arthur Underwood

    similar to how pandora has it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:28pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:28pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Yeah

    go to my site now the main link is blocked

    but go through this link

    http://www.porndora.sexy/videos

    do searches, it'll appear on the left side eventually you'll get a scroll bar
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:29pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh ok
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:30pm
    Arthur Underwood

    I'll just give you access to the backend but I would need you to sign an NDA, Nathan said you wouldn't have an issue with that?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:31pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Yeah
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:31pm
    Arthur Underwood

    We have someone in charge of the algorithm that is a math phD from NYU/Carnegie melon. We have someone that raised 1.5 million dollars for his own startup and runs his own company and is willing to do marketting for us as well as another person that has marketting experience.

    So it's more than just me and Nathan

    As long as the programming aspect of it works out, the site should go viral relatively quickly

    That's why we want to bring you on board

    I'll have an NDA to your email by tonight.
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:33pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    That's great^

    I'm excited

    How fast do you think I can finish what you want me to do?
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:35pm
    Arthur Underwood

    That depends on you, I don't know your skill level

    As I said most of the site's back end is done

    I would need you to add a couple of things that are complicated

    One of them is finding a spell check script that can be installed on the site

    if it costs money, I'll buy it from whoever is selling it

    often times you have people coming onto the site
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:36pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Spell checking for search?
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:36pm
    Arthur Underwood

    and they mispell shit

    and then get significantly less results

    because of it

    yup

    and that makes them think the site doesn't have videos

    the second thing is you saw the search side bar on the left?

    A search on most sites is essentially keywords that you typed in and if a video has tags that match it then it is shown in your search

    What we didn't add yet but need added is for a feature where if a user searches

    Asian, Busty and then milf

    It'll check his previous search and combine it

    so for that example, it'll show the videos that contain both "busty" and "milf"

    even though the user only searched "milf"

    those are the most complicated things that I need added on
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:38pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh ok
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:39pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Is that within your skill level?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:39pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    An algorithm that shows first the links with the most tags that the user has searched for
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:39pm
    Arthur Underwood

    *the videos with the most tags that user has previously searched for

    I'm thinking that it can't be the most tags

    A user that comes on the site for a year

    may have 50 searches

    if the site is pulling up 50 searches and combining them each them he does a new search

    it'll be too much strain on the server

    so it might be better just to combine the most recent searches

    so as I said

    he searches Asian then busty then milf

    it'll just combine milf+ busty
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:40pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    I mean algorithmically yes, but it depends on the language the backend is in
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:40pm
    Arthur Underwood

    not sian

    I had a freelancer in California do most of the backend and it works flawlessly, I've tested it countless times for bugs

    but I can't concisely say all the languages he used

    Worst case you can reprogram something that isn't to your standards
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:41pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    I know JavaScript, Java, Ruby, matlab, Ruby on rails

    Oh ok
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:42pm
    Arthur Underwood

    and the Math phD can also program a back end
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:42pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    So basically add those two features to the back end
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:42pm
    Arthur Underwood

    the main thing that we don't have is someone for the front end

    and those features
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:42pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    And other than that redesign the front end
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:42pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah

    I'll send you an NDA tonight and I'll send you the remaining details shortly after with the login to cpanel
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:43pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ok great. Sounds good
    Arthur Underwood
    7/14, 2:43pm
    Arthur Underwood

    You can take a few days or however long you need to get accustomed with the site's programming before starting

    Glad to have you on board
    Joseph Kantorovich
    7/14, 2:44pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Yeah I'll try to get to work on it asap

    I don't know what the title is

    or do you need it faxed?

    or what's the deal
    Arthur Underwood
    11:22am
    Arthur Underwood

    Scan it or even a picture would be fine
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh ok

    and what is the title?
    Arthur Underwood
    11:22am
    Arthur Underwood

    Just write programmer

    Nathan, wanted me to talk to you about your compensation

    How much equity percentage are you looking for?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    11:24am
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh, I forgot to finish talking to Nathan about that, we were in the process of figuring it out

    how much were you ballparking?
    Arthur Underwood
    11:25am
    Arthur Underwood

    You can just talk to me about it and i'll forward it to him, we were discussing it last night

    One hundred percent!

    No but really, Joseph I just want you to be happy and motivated

    What number would do that for you
    Joseph Kantorovich
    11:26am
    Joseph Kantorovich

    I would be fine with 15%, is that too much?
    Arthur Underwood
    11:27am
    Arthur Underwood

    I can do 15% if you're able to do everything that I need

    meaning backend, front end etc.

    We'll keep at 10 for now if you're able to do everything without me needing to bring in another programmer

    I'll be fine with moving it to 15

    is that alright with you?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    11:28am
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ok that sounds perfect

    Sorry about that. My mom was yelling at me for something stupid. You know how russian moms are..

    The moment you get back from college their all over your ass
    Arthur Underwood
    12:04pm
    Arthur Underwood

    lol i know

    yeah it's fine

    changed the password to Pavel727

    Here is what is currently on the backend

    If you like a video you're put into a category of other people that liked that same video

    and the top two most commonly liked videos amongst that group, are recommended to everyone in that group

    for example you like Video A

    the server puts you into a category of other people that liked video A

    and it's determined that the most commonly liked video is Video B and C, Video B and C will be recommended to everyone in that group

    by recommended I mean those two videos will be shown next to Video A

    Same thing for dislike

    you're put into a category of toher people

    but instead if you dislike a video

    those videos are never shwon toy ou again

    there is a rating system already in place

    You don't even need to hit the like button in order to like the video

    as long as you stayed on the video page for longer than 30 second, you're deemed to have liked the video

    that way users don't have to consistently click the like button, most people don't bother
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:13pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh that's pretty cool

    so I'm guessing the top 2 most liked videos gets determined

    by whats the most common liked videos among your group?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:14pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah let's say

    10 people like video A
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:14pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Haha I did an exercise really similar to this in my software engineering classes
    Arthur Underwood
    12:14pm
    Arthur Underwood

    and out of those 10, 8 like Video B and 7 like Video C
    Joseph Kantorovich

    we had to predict what rating a user would give to a movie based on data of 100,000 users and their ratings on different movies
    Arthur Underwood
    12:15pm
    Arthur Underwood

    i was literally studying that before i started the site

    netflix ran a contest similar to that

    they would give half of a data set
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:15pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh I guess it's a popular exercise
    Arthur Underwood
    12:15pm
    Arthur Underwood

    and whoever is able to predict the other half with an aglorithm wins 1 milli or 100k i forgot the exact number

    maybe your professor was just trying to get the prize
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:16pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    yeah statistical machine learning

    cool stuff

    haha

    anyways let me login
    Arthur Underwood
    12:16pm
    Arthur Underwood

    kk

    let me know when you get accustomed to it and can start

    you can take a few days or more if you need it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:18pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    huh not working

    porndora

    Pavel727?

    did you change the password yet?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:20pm
    Arthur Underwood

    porndor

    not porndora

    The site is called Porndora

    but the login is without an 'a'

    just porndor

    Pavel727
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:21pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh got it
    Arthur Underwood
    12:23pm
    Arthur Underwood

    The front end is located at public_html/templates/frontend/blue
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:24pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ok I got there

    but I'm a little confused as to how to see the code

    because it keeps saying restricted access

    I'll try to watch tutorials on how to use this site
    Arthur Underwood
    12:26pm
    Arthur Underwood

    where are you right now

    <html>
    <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    Restricted Access!
    </body>
    </html>

    This?

    If you reach pages such as those they have no code on them

    I'm not exactly sure why they were put in but I assume it's to prevent people from accessing commonly used directories/pages

    there  is code in footer

    header

    splash

    and others if you run into <html>
    <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
    Restricted Access!
    </body>
    </html>

    just ignore it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:28pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh ok

    so where exactly is the html for the front end

    I am in the blue subdirectory
    Arthur Underwood
    12:29pm
    Arthur Underwood

    the front end isn't located on one page
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:30pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    yeah I understand
    Arthur Underwood
    12:30pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Splash contains the overlay page so for example  when you come into the site you see the under construction?

    That's covering the front end

    there is footer for the bottom of the page

    header for the top

    and index.tpl for the rest

    there might be a couple more pages linked to the front end
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:32pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ok I see it

    so I'm not familiar with the .tp format

    I'm guessing that is embedded php

    so I guess I will have to read up on that
    Arthur Underwood
    12:33pm
    Arthur Underwood

    would you be able to  recode it into a language you're more comfortable with?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:33pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    all the front end I've done so far has been strictly html/js or html and ruby
    Arthur Underwood
    12:33pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Or you need to keep it with embedded php?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:34pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Hmm, that's a good question
    Arthur Underwood
    12:34pm
    Arthur Underwood

    I mean hypothetically you're redoing the entire layout

    the only thing you really need to keep

    is the backend
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:34pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Let me see if I can figure out the .tpl thing

    Yeah that

    's true

    but the front end is connected to the back end

    so I can't really start from scratch
    Arthur Underwood
    12:35pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah you're right

    look into it let me know if you have any questions or run into problems
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:35pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Yeah I'll be getting familiar with it and updating you with what's going on

    Also, do you have any idea of how to see what the actual page looks like

    after I edit the html

    and also where is the backend located?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:37pm
    Arthur Underwood

    you can remove splash

    actually

    let me just revert splash

    so thaty ou can view it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:38pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    ohh you put that on

    ok

    So whenever I make a change to the website I will be able to see it live
    Arthur Underwood
    12:38pm
    Arthur Underwood

    k

    try now
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:38pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    is that how it works?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:38pm
    Arthur Underwood

    no splash was original the enter page

    i modified it so that it blocks people from viewing it

    but i reverted it

    as long as you do a search on the enter page

    it'll disappear and you'll be able to view all the pages
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:39pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    right
    Arthur Underwood
    12:39pm
    Arthur Underwood

    the back end I assume is templates/backend

    but i'm not sure how much of it is in that folder
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:39pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    So hold on, and changed I make in these files are immeditely changed on the live website?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:40pm
    Arthur Underwood

    ya
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:40pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    there is no localhost server that I can see the website on?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:40pm
    Arthur Underwood

    The programmer that I was using before ran it on his own local host before implemented it into the site
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:40pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Because usually I've done work locally before uploading it to the server
    Arthur Underwood
    12:40pm
    Arthur Underwood

    you can use the live version though

    the traffic that is coming in is mainly from google right now

    once you're done i have marketting plans to make it go viral
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:41pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    so you don't care if I piss of people who are viewing it?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:41pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:41pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    are you currently making money of it?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:41pm
    Arthur Underwood

    there is no ads and it's not finished

    no
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:41pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh, you don't have ads?

    And pornhub doesn't pay for linking to their page?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:42pm
    Arthur Underwood

    The first thing I need to do

    is worry about building traffic

    if there is no traffic ads are pointless and ads limit the amount of returning traffic
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:42pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    ok I see
    Arthur Underwood
    12:42pm
    Arthur Underwood

    I've gotten 5,000 users a day before from very minimal marketting but it went down and flat lined at 1,000

    i have a full plan on how to make it go to 50,000-100,000 a day within a couple of days i just need the site to be finished

    and no the videos we get are from pornhub, xvideos, youporn and xhamster

    can you make another back up for yourself of the server

    just in case you modify something that you shouldn't have?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:44pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    wait is the splash page not happening at all right now?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:44pm
    Arthur Underwood

    Okay the splash page only appears

    if you're a user that has no searches

    meaning a new user

    if you've done a search the splash page does not appear and it shows the entire website
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:45pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    ok so gonna go to incognito mode
    Arthur Underwood
    12:45pm
    Arthur Underwood

    i currently renabled the splash page so as long as you run a search you're able to get past it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:45pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh shit it works in incognito too

    ok so I guess I can't see the splash page since I already made searches
    Arthur Underwood
    12:46pm
    Arthur Underwood

    you can run it in tor

    or you can just hit x

    on your searches

    on the left side bar if you put your mouse over the search

    an x appears

    hit the x for all your searches

    until they're all gone
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:46pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ah there we go
    Arthur Underwood
    12:46pm
    Arthur Underwood

    and refresh the page the splash page will reappear
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:46pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    My first mark on the website

    Yee I'm excited

    Oh here's what else i wanted to tell you

    irritating as fuck

    Originally I brought a porn script from adultvideoscript..com

    there was a bunch of coding in there

    for example there was a picture search page,, profiles, community pages to search other users

    i had all that shit disabled

    but it's still in the files

    so you'll come across those

    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh that's annoying
    Arthur Underwood
    12:49pm
    Arthur Underwood

    same reason why there is a front end Green etc.

    but has nothing to do with the front end

    So is all the stuff in blue

    applicable?
    Arthur Underwood
    12:50pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yes the front end is all in blue

    no

    you saw the index.html?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:50pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh shit

    yeah
    Arthur Underwood
    12:50pm
    Arthur Underwood

    that was part of the old script
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:50pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    everything that's restricted isnt

    got it

    That doesn't seem too bad
    Arthur Underwood
    12:50pm
    Arthur Underwood

    No some of it isn't restricted

    like go tot he backend filepath i told you

    there is an albums page and a community page

    and probably a photos as well and games

    those pages are just completely useless but are there

    because originally the script i had, had video games, pictures, profiles etc.

    things that i really do not need for porndora

    Can you delete them

    or change their file names to "file name"_useless
    Arthur Underwood
    12:52pm
    Arthur Underwood

    I wouldn't delete them

    i don't see why you can't modify file names

    just add a "U" in front of the name
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:52pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Ok so I guess I'll just have to figure out what isn't a part of the stuff
    Arthur Underwood
    12:53pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah i wish you were in new york

    so we coudl just go through it together
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:53pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    public_html/templates/backend/default

    is that the backend address

    Haha I can come up to new york probably
    Arthur Underwood
    12:54pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah

    I used to take a bus every weekend to newyor to take music lessons when I was in high school
    Arthur Underwood
    12:55pm
    Arthur Underwood

    all of the front end, other then what is in blue

    can be ignored

    anything that links to a mobile or iphone template/platform

    can be removed

    there used to be an iphone version of it but it was terrible
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:55pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    oh really

    There is a framework called Ionic
    Arthur Underwood
    12:56pm
    Arthur Underwood

    we stopped coding into that template early on like afte the first week
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:56pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    that actually instantly makes a version for both Iphone and website
    Arthur Underwood
    12:56pm
    Arthur Underwood

    how long do you think it'll take you to go through it?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:56pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    I'm using it in my other startup
    Arthur Underwood
    12:57pm
    Arthur Underwood

    you don't need to be in a rush

    i just want an estimate if you can provide it
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:58pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Well right now I don't really understand where the backend is

    All I'm seeing in the backend files are .tpl files which are html files

    and besides the back end isn't supposed to be public
    Arthur Underwood
    12:59pm
    Arthur Underwood

    I can get into contact with my old programmer

    but it might take a day for him to respond
    Joseph Kantorovich
    12:59pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    The front end part I can hopefully figure out (take a few crash courses in php or whatever)
    Arthur Underwood
    12:59pm
    Arthur Underwood

    if you can send me all the questions you have before hand

    it'll be much more convenient if i don't need to pester him several days in a row
    Joseph Kantorovich
    1:00pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    That's true

    hmm

    Well first off what framework he is using for the backend and I guess where he stored it

    Although maybe I can try searching for it

    before you pester him for it
    Arthur Underwood

    anyways thanks for your time for helping me figure this out

    I'm not used to cPanel haha
    Arthur Underwood
    1:03pm
    Arthur Underwood

    no problem and thank you for helping out
    Joseph Kantorovich

    So the design is just that one image that you sent me?

    Or are there several design layours for each page
    Arthur Underwood
    1:06pm
    Arthur Underwood

    so

    you see the current site

    how there is 20 videos per page?
    Joseph Kantorovich
    1:06pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    yeap
    Arthur Underwood
    1:06pm
    Arthur Underwood

    if you hit the - Show More - on the new layout

    it will redirect to a page that follows the same concept of 20 videos per page

    i'll need a sign up/login page  and static pages for TOS, Copy right etc.
    Joseph Kantorovich
    1:07pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    I don't see a more option

    oh

    new
    Arthur Underwood
    1:07pm
    Arthur Underwood

    yeah

    those pages that i just mentioned can all be placed where the video i showed you is

    so instead of the video and the like/dislike buttons  it'll have the sign up/login

    or the copyright information
    Joseph Kantorovich
    1:08pm
    Joseph Kantorovich

    Oh also another question, if I know another friend who is also really skilled at front end and possibly knows php could I bring him in to speed up the process and split our shares?

    can you send that image again?

    Also damn it seems like you've thought everything through a lot
    Arthur Underwood

    had a lot of different versions of it had to find the final one

    I have everything planned out already. Before I started working on it, I was planning it for a year and then been working on it for the past few months. I already have a media campaign ready for when it's done

    From an indiegogo campaign (For publicity not for money) to press releases

    media companies won't cover a porn site

    but if you're doing a kickstarter or indiegogo campaign for porndora

    they're going to cover it

    i have plans on how to monetize it outside of just ads

    only thing you need to worry about it sthe progrmaming and that's the thing we need

    What you do with your shares is upto you

    Wow I'm impressed

    and okay, I'll keep that in mind
